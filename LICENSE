  0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO, except money. No money fer you with me shite!
  
  1. I can hear your gears grinding conceiving up schemes to make monies with me shite. The answer is an unequivocal, resounding, unmistakable "NO". There will be NO monies made with me shite in perpetuity. From whatever possible monetary form there currently is available, will in the future be available or was in the past available. Absolutely no money made with my shite what-so-fucking-ever.
  
  2. For anything else: DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO
